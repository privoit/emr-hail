# Hail on EMR
This solution was designed to provide a reproducible, easy to deploy environment to integrate [Hail](https://hail.is) with [AWS EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/faqs/?nc=sn&loc=7).  Where possible, AWS native tools have been used.

To integrate Hail and EMR, we leverage [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) from Hashicorp alongside [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/faqs/?nc=sn&loc=5) to create a custom AMI pre-packaged with Hail, and optionally containing the [Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)](https://uswest.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html).  Then, an EMR cluster is launched using this custom AMI.

Users access Jupyter via a SageMaker notebook hosted in AWS, and pass commands to Hail from the notebook via [Apache Livy](https://livy.incubator.apache.org/).  

This repository contains CloudFormation templates, scripts, and sample notebooks which will enable you to deploy this solution in your own AWS account. Certain parts of this repository assume a working knowledge of:  AWS, CloudFormation, S3, EMR, Hail, Jupyter, SageMaker, EC2, Packer, and shell scripting.  

The repository is organized into several directories:

- cloudformation - Contains the templates used to deploy resources in AWS
- packer - Documenation and example configuration of Packer (used in the AMI build process)
- jupyter - Sample Jupyter Notebook for SageMaker deployment

This ReadMe will walk through deployment steps, and highlight potential pitfalls.

## Deployment Guide
Deploying Hail on EMR in AWS is complicated, but everything needed to create a reproducible cluster and manage it via Jupyter is contained in this repository. 

To deploy this Hail on EMR, follow these steps:  

1. Log into your AWS account, and access the CloudFormation console
2. Deploy the [hail-s3](#hail-s3) template to create S3 resources
2. Deploy the [hail-jupyter](#hail-jupyter) template to create the SageMaker notebook instance
3. Deploy the [hail-ami](#hail-ami) template (optional) to create the custom AMI build process using CodeBuild and Packer
4. Deploy the [hail-emr](#hail-emr) template to create the EMR cluster using a custom Hail AMI

The order is important, as resources created by one stack may be used as parameter entries to later stacks.

## CloudFormation Templates

This section lists the templates used in the Deployment Guide, and walks through deployment.

### hail-s3

This template is deployed `once`.

The template consumes 3 parameters, and creates 3 S3 buckets with [Server-Side Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html) (SSE).

- Hail Bucket - contains VEP cache and configuration JSON for Hail
- Log Bucket - EMR logs will be written here
- SageMaker Jupyter Bucket - Users notebooks will be backed up here, and common/example notebooks will be stored here as well.

*Note: S3 bucket names MUST be unique.  If the S3 bucket name is in use elsewhere, deployment will fail*

### hail-jupyter

This template can be deployed `multiple times` (one per user).  

The template deploys a SageMaker notebook instance which will be used for operations against the Hail EMR cluster.  The user's `/home/ec2-user/SageMaker` directory is backed up via crontab to the SageMaker Jupyter bucket created in the previous step with the `hail-s3` CloudFormation template.  

The user's notebook instance will have full control via the AWS CLI over their respective S3 subdirectory.  For example, if a notebook instance is named `aperry`, the user has full control of S3 objects in `s3://YOUR_JUPYTER_BUCKET/aperry/` from the terminal on that instance via the AWS CLI.

When a new notebook instance launches, the instance will sync in any scripts in the following directories located in the root of the bucket to the following locations on the local instance:

- `common-notebooks` => `/home/ec2-user/SageMaker/common-notebooks`
- `scripts` => `/home/ec2-user/SageMaker/bin`

You may wish to seed those directories in S3 with the identically named directories under `emr-hail/jupyter` in this repository.  Doing so will allow for a working Hail Plotting example.

CLI Example from repository root directory:

```bash
aws --profile <PROFILE> s3 sync jupyter/ s3://<YOUR_JUPYTER_BUCKET>/ --acl bucket-owner-full-control
```

Post upload, the bucket contents should look similar to this:

```bash
14:16 $ aws --profile <PROFILE> s3 ls --recursive s3://<YOUR_JUPYTER_BUCKET>/

2019-09-30 14:14:36       1244 scripts/list-clusters
2019-09-30 14:14:36       1244 scripts/ssm
```

### hail-ami

This template is deployed `once`.

This template leverages [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) in AWS CodeBuild to create AMIs for use with EMR.  You can specify a specific Hail Version, VEP version, and target VPC and subnet.

Review the [expanded documentation](packer/readme.md) for further details.

### hail-emr

This template can be deployed `multiple times` (one per cluster).

This template deploys the EMR cluster using the custom Hail AMI.  There is a single master node, a minimum of 1 core node, and optional autoscaling task nodes.

#### Autoscaling Task Nodes

Task nodes can be set to `0` to omit them.   The target market, `SPOT` or `ON_DEMAND`, is also set via parameters.  If `SPOT` is selected, the bid price is set to the current on demand price of the selected instance type.

The following scaling actions are set by default:

- +2 instances when YARNMemoryAvailablePercentage < 15 % over 5 min
- +2 instances when ContainerPendingRatio > .75 over 5 min
- -2 instances when YARNMemoryAvailablePercentage > 75 % over 5 min

#### Plotting

EMR steps are used to add a location for Livy to output Hail plots directly to files on the master node.   Once written there those plots can be retrieved in the Sagemaker notebook instance and plotted inline.  See the [jupyter/common-notebooks/hail-plotting-example.ipynb](jupyter/common-notebooks/hail-plotting-example.ipynb) for an example.

The plotting pass through is required because the Sparkmagic/Livy can only pass spark and pandas dataframes back to the notebook.

#### SSM Access

The [AWS Systems Manager Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html) can be used to gain ingress to the EMR nodes.  This agent is pre-installed on the AMI.  CloudFormation parameters exist on both the EMR stack and the Jupyter stack to optionally allow notebook IAM roles shell access to the EMR nodes via SSM.  The respective stack parameters must both be set to `true` to allow proper IAM access.

Example connection from Jupyter Lab shell:
